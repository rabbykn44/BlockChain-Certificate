# 🎓 Blockchain-Based Certificate Validation System

This is a Python-based desktop application that uses **blockchain technology** to ensure the authenticity of academic certificates. It uses **SHA-256 hashing** to create digital signatures and saves them to a tamper-proof blockchain. Users can validate certificates by checking if the signature exists in the chain.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Store digital certificates securely
- 🔐 SHA-256 hashing ensures data integrity
- ⛓️ Blockchain stores all certificate transactions immutably
- 🧾 Validates uploaded certificates and detects tampering
- 💻 GUI interface built with Tkinter for easy interaction
- 💾 Persistent storage using Pickle

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Saving a Certificate:
1. User selects a certificate file (e.g., PDF, image).
2. The file is hashed using SHA-256 to create a digital signature.
3. Student information (Roll, Name, Contact) is combined with the hash.
4. A new transaction is created and mined into the blockchain.
5. The blockchain is saved to `blockchain_contract.txt`.

### Validating a Certificate:
1. User uploads a certificate file.
2. The app computes its hash and searches the blockchain.
3. If found, student details are displayed.
4. If not, the certificate is considered invalid or altered.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧱 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not:
```bash
pip install tk
````

### ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python main.py
```

A window will open with:

* "Save Certificate" button
* "Varification Certificate" button (should be “Verification” – typo fix recommended)
* "Exit" button

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

1. Click **"Save Certificate"** → Choose a certificate file → Enter student info.
2. The file is hashed and stored in the blockchain.
3. Click **"Varification Certificate"** → Choose the same file to verify.

Would you like me to also prepare the `Block.py` and `Blockchain.py` code files in the same style as your `main.py`?
